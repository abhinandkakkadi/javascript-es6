Real world use case

lets say we want to display our feed with latest update in a social media app like istagram
for that the server can effectively takes in all the post details of our friends as array of object
for each object in the array same kind of template/component is added and a fresh array with this change can be retrieved.
so for data rendering application to front end this can be used.
